# chess - A simple console chess game.

HELLO WORLD!
My name is Marvin Fuchs. Im a Python Beginner. To gain experience
in Python developing I implemented the logic of chess enhanced in a console programm.
It is for sure that there is still a lot of optimizing to be done. 
After having completed the logic of chess and the necessary optimization I am 
looking forward to build a GUI using Tkinter.
I hope you enjoy my work.

Edit: LOGIC COMPLETED!

EDIT1: Im starting the transformation of the console chess game to a minimalistic GUI.

EDIT2: The chess game can be played with the GUI. To accept a move consisting of choosing the figure and choosing
      its destination, one has to close the GUI window. A new window with the next step (either question 
      which figure to choose or question which destination to choose) will appear. Still the transformation from 
      a console chess game to a GUI oriented chess is in progress. But everything seems to work out, even when its
      quick and dirty sometimes.
  
EDIT3: The multithreading works out! 
       After hitting the start button player one can select with a mouse click TWICE
       on the specific white figure which figure to move. After that player one needs to click TWICE on the destination field.
       Clicking twice is used to prevent irrational input. Hit the update button and you can view the updated board!
       Now its the turn of Player black and the cycle continues.
      
HOW DO I SET IT UP?
      Just execute the game.py file with python3. A console and a GUI are going to appear.
      
If you can report any bugs, please let me know.

HAVE FUN!
