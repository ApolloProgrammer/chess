# chess - A simple console chess game.

HELLO WORLD!
My name is Marvin Fuchs. Im a Python Beginner. To gain experience
in Python developing I implemented the logic of chess enhanced in a console programm.
It is for sure that there is still a lot of optimizing to be done. 
After having completed the logic of chess and the necessary optimization I am 
looking forward to build a GUI using Tkinter.
I hope you enjoy my work.

Edit: only one piece of logic is missing in the chess game.
      When a pawn reaches the border of the opposite site of the field,
      then the player should be able to choose whether he wants to trade a queen,...
      for the pawn.
