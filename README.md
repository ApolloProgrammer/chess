# chess - A simple console chess game.

HELLO WORLD!
My Name is Marvin Fuchs. Im a Python Beginner. To gain strong experience
in Python developing I implemented the logic of chess enhanced in a console programm.
It is for sure that there is still a lot of optimizing to be done. 
After having completed the logic of chess and the necessary optimization I am 
looking forward to build a GUI using Tkinter.
I hope you enjoy my work.
