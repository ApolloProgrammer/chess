# chess - A simple console chess game.

HELLO WORLD!
My name is Marvin Fuchs. Im a Python Beginner. To gain experience
in Python developing I implemented the logic of chess enhanced in a console programm.
It is for sure that there is still a lot of optimizing to be done. 
After having completed the logic of chess and the necessary optimization I am 
looking forward to build a GUI using Tkinter.
I hope you enjoy my work.

Edit: LOGIC COMPLETED!

EDIT: Im starting the transformation of the console chess game to a minimalistic GUI.

EDIT: The chess game can be played with the GUI. To accept a move consisting of choosing the figure and choosing
      its destination, one has to close the GUI window. A new window with the next step (either question 
      which figure to choose or question which destination to choose) will appear. Still the transformation from 
      a console chess game to a GUI oriented chess is in progress. But everything seems to work out, even when its
      quick and dirty sometimes.
      
HOW DO I SET IT UP?
      Just execute the game.py file with python3. A console and a GUI are going to appear.
      
If you can report any bugs, please let me know.

HAVE FUN!
